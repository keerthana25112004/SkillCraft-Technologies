# Image Encryption Tool

## Overview
This project is a web-based image encryption tool developed as part of Task 02 for SkillCraft Technology. It leverages pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt images by swapping red and blue channel values, offering a simple yet effective approach to secure image data. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool runs entirely in the browser, making it accessible and easy to use.

## Features
- Upload any image file for encryption.
- Apply a basic pixel manipulation technique (swapping red and blue channels).
- Download the encrypted image with a single click.
- User-friendly interface with real-time processing.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. Click "Choose File" to upload an image (e.g., `flower.jpg`).
4. Click "Encrypt Image" to process the image.
5. Click "Download Encrypted Image" to save the result.

## Installation
No installation is required! Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. The tool uses client-side JavaScript, so no server setup is needed.

## Output
The encrypted image will have its red and blue color channels swapped, visually altering the appearance (e.g., red areas turn blue, and blue areas turn red). To decrypt, re-upload the encrypted image and run the encryption again (swapping twice restores the original).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure and file input.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For image processing and encryption logic.
